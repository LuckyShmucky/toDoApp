I am going to make a to do app to strengthen my understanding of programming and creating web applications

## Features I want to include 

- [x] Application needs to have CRUD methods
- [x] Application needs to save list items so if user leaves the page items are still there
- [x] I would like to be able to send a notification to users if one of the things the user has to do has to be done at a certain time or date.
